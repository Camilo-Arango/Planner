# Project Description

This project was to practice our understanding of third-party APIs. We were given starter code (HTML/CSS) and tasked to write the Javascript from scratch. 

The HTML was essentially done but we needed to add the text boxes for each time block. For this I used the Bootstrap API because it would allow me to easily format the boxes, the buttons, and the margins of each thing easily with their preset classes that would allow me to distribute the spacing however I wanted.

For the Javascript, I first added the dynamic clock by using jQuery to reference the Moment API. I then used jQuery to write a function that references the assigned id for each of the rows with the current hour using Moment's API and then I used if-else statements to format the rows based on whether or not the referenced time value is before during or after the current hour to assign appropriate classes from the css to the corresponding situation.

I then used javascript to add an event listener to store the information from the planner with a click event.
